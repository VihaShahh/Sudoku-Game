# Sudoku-Game

Hello Connections, I'm excited to share a Sudoku puzzle generator that I recently developed in Java!

ðŸ”¸This program utilizes a backtracking algorithm to generate a fully solved Sudoku board and then removes cells to create a puzzle.

ðŸ”¹The level of difficulty can be adjusted by modifying the number of empty cells. Every time the program is run, it generates a brand new Sudoku puzzle, providing endless challenges for puzzle enthusiasts.

ðŸ”¸The solveBoard() method recursively solves the Sudoku board, while the isValid() method checks the validity of each digit placement. The printBoard() method displays the Sudoku board on the console.

ðŸ”¹If you're interested in trying it out, feel free to check out the code below! I'd love to hear your feedback and any improvements you might have. Happy puzzling! ðŸ¤“ðŸŽ‰
